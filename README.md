## How to Use These Files
### Overview
Feedreader is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.

### Instructions
To move the character use the arrow keys.

### Dependencies
A modern browser running JavaScript and the included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) 2.1.2 library is all that is needed.

### Acknowledgements
See source code for acknowledgements. Many others' ideas were used in creating this game.
